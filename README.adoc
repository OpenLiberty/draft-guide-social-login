NOTE: This repository contains the guide documentation source. To view the guide in published form, view it on the https://openliberty.io/guides/{projectid}.html[Open Liberty website^].

Learn how to authenticate users with the Open Liberty Social Media Login feature.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to authenticate users to an existing service using social media login
https://oauth.net/2[OAuth2^] and https://openid.net/connect[OpenID Connect^].

=== OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect 1.0
==== Authorization
Authorization is the process of granting access rights/privileges to a user's resources.
https://oauth.net/2[OAuth 2.0^] is the industry-standard protocol for authorization.
https://oauth.net/2[OAuth 2.0^] provides specific authorization flows for
web applications, desktop applications, mobile phones, and smart devices.

The scope of https://oauth.net/2[OAuth 2.0^] authorization limits an application's access to a user's account.
An application can request one or more scopes for authorization.
https://oauth.net/2[OAuth 2.0^] can be used to authenticate users when the requested scope of authorization is basic public profile information.

==== Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity.
https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Cnonect 1.0^] is an authentication layer on top of the
https://oauth.net/2[OAuth 2.0^] protocol.
https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Cnonect 1.0^] allows clients for all types:
web applications, desktop applications, mobile phones and smart devices.

=== Social Login and its purpose
Social Media Login provides a form of single sign-on (SSO) that enables users to sign in to a secured website by using
their existing social media account.
Social Media Login simplifies the authentication process for end users and allows you to provide a secure authentication
method for your users without having to explicitly implement it.

Open Liberty provides a https://openliberty.io/docs/ref/feature/#socialLogin-1.0.html[Social Media Login Feature^]
that provides configuration elements can enable Social Login for any social media platform that implements
the https://oauth.net/2[OAuth 2.0^] or https://openid.net/connect[OpenID Connect 1.0^] standard for authorization.`

By the end of this guide, you will be able to authenticate users to your web service using Facebook and Twitter.

== Setting up the certificates

The application you will build in this guide requires a server certificate that your application will provide for HTTPS connections, and corresponding private key to decrypt the incoming secure data.
This certificate and private key will need to be added to the keystore for social media login.
You also need to create an application on the three social media developer platforms to obtain a client ID and client secret to use their APIs.

First, navigate to the `start/src/main/liberty/config/resources/security` directory.

=== Generating a self signed certificate
Your application requires a TLS server certificate and corresponding private key to securely communicate using HTTPS. In this section, you will
generate a self signed certificate and add it to your `key.p12`, which will be your application's keystore.

To create a self-signed certificate and add it to `key.p12` using the Java `keytool`,
run the following command. Replace `[keystore-password]` with a password for your keystore.
You will need this password in later sections in the guide.

== Securing HelloService

`HelloService` is the provided microservice that responds to a `GET` request with the following Plain Text response:

[source,role="no_copy"]
----
Hello, friend!
----

First, navigate to the `start` directory.

[role='command']
include::{common-includes}/devmode-start.adoc[]

The [hotspot=helloService]`HelloService` class is the JAX-RS service that you will be securing.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"] 
----
#Replace the `HelloService` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/sociallogin/HelloService.java`
----

The following new imports are required for the [hotspot=helloService]`HelloService` class:

- [hotspot=rolesAllowedImport]`javax.annotation.security.RolesAllowed`
- [hotspot=securityContextImport]`javax.ws.rs.core.SecurityContext`
- [hotspot=contextImport]`javax.ws.rs.core.Context`

The [hotspot=rolesAllowed]`@RolesAllowed({"users"})` annotation restricts access to the service to users who are
in the `users` role.

The `return "Hello, friend!";` is replaced to output user information.
The [hotspot=securityContext]`SecurityContext` context, which is injected using the
[hotspot=securityContext]`@Context` annotation, allows you to get information about the logged-in user
using [hotspot=userPrincipal]`securitContext.getUserPrincipal()`.

HelloService.java 
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright'] 
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/sociallogin/HelloService.java[]
----

== Configuring the security and social media login

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"] 
----
#Replace the server configuration file.#
`src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`
----

server.xml 
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[]
----

The explanations for these changes are in the following sections.

=== Configuring the security roles

The [hotspot=applicationBnd]`<application-bnd />` configuration element under the
[hotspot=webApplication]`<webApplication />` configuration element creates a new security role [hotspot=users]`users`,
which all authenticated users belong to.
Adding this allows users that are authenticated using social media login to access your `HelloService` service.

=== Adding required features

To enable https://openliberty.io/docs/ref/feature/#socialLogin-1.0.html[Social Media Login feature^] and other required features,
new [hotspot=newFeatures]`<feature />` elements are added to the [hotspot=featureManager]`<featureManager />` in
`server.xml`.

There are some prerequisite configurations that social media login configuration elements need:

1. The [hotspot=keystore]`<keyStore id="defaultKeyStore" .../>` configuration element
corresponds to the keystore created in the prerequisites section
2. An [hotspot=sslConfig]`<ssl id="authServiceSslRef .../>` configuration element for configuring the SSL configuration that is used to connect to the social media

=== Adding keystore and truststore

In the first section, you created a keystore, `key.p12`.
Now you will configure your application to use this keystore.
Files in the `src/main/liberty` folder are copied into the location specified by `${server.output.dir}`,
so the location of this keystore is `${server.output.dir}/resources/security`.

The [hotspot=keystore]`<keyStore id="defaultKeyStore" .../>` configuration element, whose location is `${server.output.dir}/resources/security/key.p12`,
will be used to provide SSL certificates when initiating HTTPS connections for social media login.

[role="code_command hotspot=sections", subs="quotes"] 
----
#Update the `server.xml` file.#
`src/liberty/config/server.xml`
----
[role="edit_command_text"]
Replace [hotspot=22]`[keystore-password]` with the password that you used when creating the keystore in the previous sections.

The [hotspot=sslConfig]`<ssl id="authServiceSslRef" .../>` configuration element, which references [hotspot=keystore]`<keyStore id="defaultKeyStore" .../>` as the keystore, will be provided to social media login configurations.

For your application to send data securely to the social media platforms, it must trust the public SSL certificates
provided by them.
This requires the SSL certificates for Amazon, Google and GitHub to be added to a truststore.

Since the platforms in this guide use a well-known CA (Certificate Authority), they can be
found in the JDK default `cacerts` file.

The [hotspot=30]`trustDefaultCerts` attribute of the [hotspot=sslConfig]`<ssl id="authServiceSslRef" .../>` configuration element,
when set to true, allows the server to establish trust using the JDK default truststore, instead of requiring
you to create a truststore with the required certificates.

=== Adding GitHub login configuration

[role="code_command hotspot=sections", subs="quotes"] 
----
#Update the `server.xml` file.#
`src/liberty/config/server.xml`
----
[role="edit_command_text"]
Replace the values of the [hotspot=43]`clientId` and [hotspot=44]`clientSecret` with the credentials you created for your GitHub application
in the prerequisites section.

The [hotspot=githubLogin]`<githubLogin />` configuration element will configure GitHub login.
The [hotspot=45]`sslRef` attribute is set to the [hotspot=sslConfig]`authServiceSslRef` configuration from the previous section.

=== Adding Amazon login configuration

[role="code_command hotspot=sections", subs="quotes"] 
----
#Update the `server.xml` file.#
`src/liberty/config/server.xml`
----
[role="edit_command_text"]
Replace the values of [hotspot=52]`clientId` and [hotspot=53]`clientSecret` with the credentials you created for your Amazon application
in the prerequisites section.

The [hotspot=amazonLogin]`amazonLogin` configuration uses a custom [hotspot=amazonLogin]`<oauth2Login />` configuration element.
The [hotspot=55]`sslRef` attribute is set to the [hotspot=sslConfig]`authServiceSslRef` configuration from the previous section.

Further documentation on the [hotspot=amazonLogin]`attributes` can be found on the https://openliberty.io/docs/ref/config/oauth2Login.html[Open Liberty config reference on oauth2Login^].
The values for these [hotspot=amazonLogin]`attributes` can be found in the https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/minitoc-lwa-overview.html[Login With Amazon API documentation^].

Make sure that the [hotspot=50]`id` of your [hotspot=amazonLogin]`<oauth2Login />` configuration matches the redirect URL (if you set the [hotspot=50]`id` to `amazonLogin`, the redirect URL must end with `.../amazonLogin`).

=== Adding Google login configuration

[role="code_command hotspot=sections", subs="quotes"] 
----
#Update the `server.xml` file.#
`src/liberty/config/server.xml`
----
[role="edit_command_text"]
Repalce the values of [hotspot=70]`clientId` and [hotspot=71]`clientSecret` with the credentials you created for your Google application
in the prerequisites section.

The [hotspot=googleOIDCLogin]`googleOIDCLogin` configuration uses a custom [hotspot=googleOIDCLogin]`<oidcLogin />` configuration element.
The [hotspot=72]`sslRef` attribute is set to the [hotspot=sslConfig]`authServiceSslRef` configuration from the previous section.

Further documentation on the [hotspot=googleOIDCLogin]`attributes` can be found on the https://openliberty.io/docs/ref/config/oidcLogin.html[Open Liberty config reference on oidcLogin^].
The values of these [hotspot=googleOIDCLogin]`attributes` can be found in the https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect[Google API documentation^].

Make sure that the [hotspot=68]`id` of your [hotspot=googleOIDCLogin]`<oidcLogin />` configuration matches the redirect URL (if you set the [hotspot=68]`id` to `googleOIDCLogin`, the redirect URL must end with `.../googleOIDCLogin`).

== Running the application

The Open Liberty server was started in development mode at the beginning of the guide and all the 
changes were automatically picked up.

Check out the service that you created at the
http://localhost:9080/api/hello[^] URL.

When you access https://localhost:9080/api/hello[^],
you should be redirected to a Social Media Login Form. This form allows you to choose which login provider you want to use
for authentication. When you select a login choice, you will be redirected to the login page of that service.

Try logging in using your social media accounts. After authenticating, you will be redirected back to https://localhost:9080/api/hello and the response will look like this:

[source,role="no_copy"]
---
Hello, <<your username>>
---

== Testing the service

No automated tests are provided in this guide.
You can test this service manually by starting a server and pointing a web browser at http://localhost:9080/api/hello[the endpoint for Hello service^].

== Great work! You're done!

You secured a simple RESTful web service in Open Liberty by using the Social Media Login feature.
