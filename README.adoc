//A getting started tutorial with examples on how to secure Java applications by authenticating users through social media
//providers, such as GitHub, using the Open Liberty Social Media Login feature.

You'll explore how to log users into your application with their social media accounts using the
Open Liberty Social Media Login feature.

== What you'll learn

Social Media Login provides a form of single sign-on (SSO) which application users can use to sign in to a secured
website with their existing social media account.
It simplifies the authentication process for users and allows you to provide a secure authentication
method for your users without having to explicitly implement it.

The https://openliberty.io/docs/ref/feature/#socialLogin-1.0.html[Social Media Login Feature^] in Open Liberty
provides configuration elements to configure application authentication using one or more social media platforms,
including GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and Google.
You can also create a custom configuration for any other social media platform that implements
the https://oauth.net/2[OAuth 2.0^] or https://openid.net/connect[OpenID Connect 1.0^] standard for authorization.

The application provided with this guide is secured through basic authentication.
The application includes a simple welcome page which includes a message and a **Log in** button.
The welcome page is defined in the [hotspot]`hello.html` file and the button is
defined in the [hotspot=btnLogin]`button` element of that page.
When the application user clicks the **Log in** button, a dialog box opens requesting the user's username and password
for authenticating to the service.
In this guide, you will replace the basic authentication dialog with a dialog to log in with a social media provider.

== Creating a GitHub OAuth2 Application

Obtain an OAuth 2.0 client ID and client secret credentials for accessing the GitHub developer API by registering
a new application in your https://github.com/[GitHub^] account.
On the https://github.com/settings/developers[Settings > Developer settings > OAuth Apps^] page of your account,
register a new application.

Set the Homepage URL to `\https://localhost:9443` and
the authorization callback URL to `\https://localhost:9443/ibm/api/social-login/redirect/githubLogin`.

When the registration is complete, the client ID and client secret credentials are displayed.
To provide your application with the credentials, export the following environment variables: `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and
`GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`.

For more information about creating an OAuth app, refer to the
https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/creating-an-oauth-app[GitHub documentation^].

Replace the values of `[github-client-id]` and `[github-client-secret]` in the following command.

== Building and running the application in dev mode

First, navigate to the `start` directory.

== Configuring GitHub as a social media login

Enable the Social Media Login feature in the application by updating the `server.xml` configuration file.

#Replace the `server.xml` file.#
`src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`

The [hotspot=socialLogin]`socialLogin-1.0` feature definition enables the Social Media Login feature in the
application so that you can the [hotspot=githubLogin file=0]`githubLogin` configuration element to
configure GitHub as a social media login.

The client ID and client secret for your GitHub OAuth2 application are injected into the
[hotspot=githubLogin]`githubLogin` configuration element with the values of `github.client.id` and
`github.client.secret`.
These values are supplied by the environment variables `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`.

Check out the service that you created at
http://localhost:9080/api/hello.html[^].

Try logging in with your social media account.
After you log in with your GitHub account, authorize access to your GitHub user data
by the OAuth application you created in the **Creating a GitHub OAuth2 Application** section.
After authentication, you are redirected to the [hotspot=login file=1]`/hello` endpoint served by
[hotspot file=2]`HelloServlet`, which serves the
[hotspot=serve file=2]`securedHello.jsp` page.

The [hotspot file=3]`securedHello.jsp` page contains a [hotspot=btnLogout file=3]`logout` button that makes a
`POST` request to the [hotspot=logout file=3]`/logout` endpoint served by [hotspot file=4]`LogoutServlet`.

Since the logout feature is not fully implemented, clicking the logout button returns an error:

[role='no_copy']

== Implementing logout

The [hotspot file=2]`LogoutServlet` provided in the `start` directory uses the
[hotspot=logout file=2]`logout()` method in the [hotspot file=2]`HttpServletRequest` class to log the user out of the
application. After logging the user out, the user is redirected to [hotspot=redirect file=2]`hello.html`.

You are also provided with a [hotspot file=1]`LogoutHandler` class and [hotspot file=3]`ILogout` interface to add
custom logout logic which revokes the application's permissions from a user's account.

The [hotspot=getLogout hotspot=inject file=2]`logoutHandler.getLogout()` method gets an implementation
of the `ILogout` interface for GitHub and uses the [hotspot=revoke file=2]`logout()` method of the `ILogout` interface
to revoke the OAuth2 permissions that are granted to the application by the user.

The response returned by this [hotspot=revoke file=2]`logout()` method is verified by the application which checks
whether it has a [hotspot=errorHandle file=2]`2xx` series status code.

The [hotspot=logout file=2]`request.logout()` method is then called to log the user out of the
application.

The [hotspot=getLogout file=2]`logoutHandler.getLogout()` method [hotspot=switch file=1]`returns` the
[hotspot=inject file=1]`implementation` of the `ILogout` interface based on the name of the social media provider that
is used by a user.
The social media provider's name is retrieved by using the [hotspot=socialMediaName file=1]`UserProfileManager` class.
The social media provider's name that is returned by the [hotspot=socialMediaName file=1]`UserProfileManager` class is
the ID of the social media login configuration.
In our application, when the application user selects GitHub, the name of the social media provider is
[hotspot=githubLoginName file=1]`githubLogin`.

Implement the [hotspot file=3]`ILogout` interface to revoke permissions for the application from the user's GitHub
account.

[role="code_command", subs="quotes"]

#Replace this `GitHubLogout` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/sociallogin/logout/GitHubLogout.java`

GitHub's REST API provides a `DELETE` endpoint, stored in the [hotspot=unauthorizeUrl file=0]`unauthorizeUrl` variable,
that is used to revoke permissions from the user for the application.
The JAX-RS [hotspot=delete file=0]`HttpClient` is used to send a request to this endpoint.

Your GitHub application's client ID and client secret are obtained from the `github.client.id` and `github.client.secret`
config properties.
These credentials are encoded and stored in the [hotspot=encodeAuth file=0]`encodedAuth` variable and added to the
request as an [hotspot=authHeader file=0]`Authorization` header.

The GitHub access token for a user, which is stored in the [hotspot=accessToken file=0]`accessToken` variable, is
retrieved from their user profile, modelled by the `UserProfile` class. The `UserProfile` object can be retrieved using
the `UserProfileManager` class.
The access token is used in the DELETE request's body, which is stored in the
[hotspot=createAccessTokenBody hotspot=addBody file=0]`requestBody` variable.

Check out the service that you created at
http://localhost:9080/api/hello.html[^].

Try logging in with your GitHub account.
After authenticating, you will be redirected to `\https://localhost:9080/api/hello`.
When you click the `logout` button, you are unauthenticated and redirected back to
http://localhost:9080/api/hello.html[^].

If you try logging in again, you are asked to reauthorize your application with GitHub, and authenticated and
redirected to `\https://localhost:9080/api/hello`.
As long as you are logged into GitHub, the application does not prompt you to enter your GitHub credentials.

== Great work! You're done!

You secured a web application in Open Liberty by using the Social Media Login feature.

== Next steps

As an exercise, configure Facebook as a second social media provider for social media login for your application.
If more than one social media login provider is added, a selection form is presented to the user. This form contains
all the possible social media providers that are configured in your application.
